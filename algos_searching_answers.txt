1. Since we have to check every element until we find G, we have
to iterate 7 times before we find the desired element using linear
search.

2. It only takes 3 iterations using binary search to find the last
element in a sorted array with length 7.

3. fib(10) = 55
   fib(11) = 89
   fib(12) = 144

#Recursive vs Iterative

1. If the array is unsorted linear search is the way to go.
I would choose iterative solution over recursive solution my
reason behind it is since recursive solution requires calculating
earlier solutions every time we calculate the next solution it takes
more computing time over iterative solution.

2. If the array is sorted, binary search comes in handy, this is
because we only have to search either the lower or upper half
which cuts the amount of elements to check by half.Since the
number of iterations is significantly low in binary search
the performance of both recursive solution is slightly faster
than iterative.
